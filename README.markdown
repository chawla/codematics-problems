#CodeBot-Problems

These are the problems for CodeBot, a similar project to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). You are welcome to fork this repository and add some new problems. Instructions will be added soon

The hash is added in the form of twice sha1 sum of the original answer. For eg. if the answer is 1, the hash would have to be `sha1sum(sha1sum(1))`.

If you'd like to include LaTex in your code, surround it by $$ like `$$\lim\x+\$$`


All problems are licenced under MIT Licence 2010. The copyright to the problem remains with the original commiter of the problem. You may be contacted to provide a working copy of the code used to get the answer.
