#CodeBot-Problems

These are the problems for CodeBot, a similar project to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). You are welcome to fork this repository and add some new problems. Instructions will be added soon

The hash is added in the form of twice sha1 sum of the original answer. For eg. if the answer is 1, the hash would have to be `sha1sum(md5(1))`. You can easily get the hash for any value by using the `hash` command in the CodeBot application.

If you'd like to include LaTex in your code, surround it by $$ like `$$\lim\x+\$$` to create a single line equation or $\sin{x} =0.1$ to create an inline equation

All problems are licenced under MIT Licence 2010. The copyright to the problem remains with the original commiter of the problem. You may be contacted to provide a working copy of the code used to get the answer.

[CodeBot](https://sdslabs.co.in/codebot) is designed and developed by [Team SDSLabs](https://github.com/sdslabs), [IIT Roorkee](http://www.iitr.ernet.in)

##Submitting Problems

To submit a problem, please fork this repository, make the requisite changes, and send us a pull request. If you are new to github, you would have to make an account. Check the excellent <help.github.com> for a getting started guide.

If you are submitting problems, please keep in mind the following :

* Problems must be solvable in a reasonable amount of time on a normal computer. 
* You must be able to provide a solution code upon request for the problem.
* Any accompanying images should be inside the `images` folder, and linked directly. CodeBot automatically uses images from this folder. Try to keep image names in consistency with your problem name.
* Problem statements must be clear, and use LaTeX, wherever possible for Math.
